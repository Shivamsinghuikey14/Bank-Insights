Advanced Bank Loan Data Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project presents an advanced Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize loan data for informed decision-making. Traditional loan reporting methods often lack interactivity and depth, making it difficult to gain actionable insights. This dashboard addresses these challenges by offering a dynamic and comprehensive analysis of lending operations, borrower behavior, and loan performance metrics.

🎯 Objectives

Develop interconnected dashboards to provide holistic insights into loan data.

Empower decision-makers with data-driven intelligence.

Improve financial performance assessment through interactive visualizations.

📊 Key Features

Dashboard 1: Executive Summary

Provides a high-level overview of critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) essential for evaluating lending performance:

Total Loan Applications - Monitor trends in total and month-to-date (MTD) applications.

Total Funded Amount - Analyze the cumulative and MTD disbursed funds.

Total Amount Received - Assess financial inflows and month-over-month (MoM) fluctuations.

Average Interest Rate - Evaluate lending costs and variations over time.

Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) - Measure borrowers' financial stability.

Dashboard 2: Loan Status Analysis

Breakdown of loans into Fully Paid, Charged Off, and Current categories.

Insights into Good vs. Bad Loans with respective funding and repayment statistics.

Analysis of Loan Performance by State, Purpose, and Term.

Dashboard 3: Borrower Demographics & Trends

Loan applications segmented by Employment Length, Home Ownership, and Loan Purpose.

Monthly trend analysis to identify seasonality in loan applications.

Interest rate and installment variations based on borrower characteristics.

Connect to the appropriate dataset (if required) and refresh the data.

Explore the insights using interactive visuals.

🔥 Insights Derived

The dataset comprises 38.6K loan applications with total funded amounts exceeding $435.8M.

Good loans account for 86.2% of the total applications, with $370.2M funded.

Bad loans make up 13.8%, with $65.5M in funding but only $37.3M received.

Loans for Debt Consolidation and Credit Card Payments dominate the portfolio.

Borrowers with a higher DTI ratio tend to have higher default risks.

📌 Future Enhancements

Integration of predictive analytics to assess default risks.

Incorporation of external financial data for trend comparison.

Improved UI/UX for better user navigation and interaction.
